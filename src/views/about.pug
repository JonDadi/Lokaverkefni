      p We used Node.js as our development platform, with Express as our web application framework and using Axios to retrieve flight data.
      p Flight data is retrieved from #[a(href="https://apis.is") https://apis.is]
      p Pug (formerly Jade) is used as a template engine.
      p Styling is done with Twitter Boostrap.
      p The #[a(href="http://www.chartjs.org/") Chart.js] library is used for creating the graphs in the statistics section.
      p The iframe holding the map is linked to #[a(href="https://www.flightradar24.com/") flightradar24.com] with filters showing only traffic inbound/outbound to/from Keflavík.

      p
      | Front page ("Flights") shows arrivals/departures to/from Keflavík airport for today's date.
      | The map on the page (not visible to small display devices) is a map showing live traffic in and out of Keflavík.
      | There is a filter in place which takes care of only showing flights to/from Keflavík, so don't be surprised if there are only a few flights (or any!) visible when you zoom out.
      p
      | The statistics page ("Statistics") shows data we found interesting, gathered from the flights that have accumulated over time in our database.
      | The data is shown visually using bar/line graphs.
      p
      | The about page ("About") is the page you are on now.
      | But you already knew that.
